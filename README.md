# Home-Grocery-Management-System

## **INTRODUCTION**:

  In this fast world, remembering the groceries in the kitchen is really a tough job for those involved in the jobs away from home. To get rid of these things, a smart kitchen shelf system will keep track of the availability of grocery items in the kitchens at home.
 This work aims to detect the groceries to be refilled and intimates the user with an alert through notification. The user should update the weight and quantity of every grocery item with their names. 
The user has to recognize the quantity, and based on the quantity of the product they have to update the time period in the app. The app will notify the user to refill the product based on the time period. 
In the future, we will change this into an app, so that every person involved in this work can utilize it. The user can add the price for each product and calculate the total amount they have spent. 
The user can give the budget for their household and they can calculate the total amount so that they can see whether the given budget is exceeded or not.
